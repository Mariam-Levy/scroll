# scroll

**This JavaScript practice implements an interactive navigation menu that expands upon clicking a specific button, enhancing accessibility on mobile devices. Furthermore, it includes a navigation bar that remains fixed at the top during scrolling, ensuring smooth navigation on extensive pages. An 'back to top' link is added for swift return to the page's top section. Additionally, upon clicking certain menu links, a smooth scroll to corresponding sections occurs instead of an abrupt jump, enhancing the overall user navigation experience.**
